# FBFreaky
The *relatively* best search engine around. Just a fun test to see how easy it is to make a search engine.

FBFreaky is a great name for a search engine that has no protections against the search results. I didn't intend for it to be named that but it just ended up that way.

FBFreaky is a search engine that relies on APIs to fetch the data therefore the results are limited and the APIs must be hardcoded. This repository is open source so you can view my code and see how you can make a version of it yourself.

The current APIs are:
  - Wikipedia
  - Reddit
  - Open Library
  - Peertube
  - Archive.org
  - Github

I'll probably make a video over this project so when it's finished I'll put the link here - :)
